# Katsudon üçöüêñ

*A Sysmon-based helper script for **dynamic malware analysis**, inspired by [Noriben](https://github.com/Rurik/Noriben).*  

Katsudon installs a dedicated Sysmon profile, collects **detailed Sysmon telemetry** while your sample runs, and, on `Ctrl+C` exports the log to a TSV before restoring (or uninstalling) Sysmon.
Its key advantage is that it surfaces **Process Access events (Event ID 10)**‚Äîcalls such as `WriteProcessMemory`, `VirtualAllocEx`, and others that can be overlooked in typical Procmon-based workflows.

That said, the resulting TSV is noticeably busier than Noriben‚Äôs streamlined Procmon output and can be a bit harder to scan at a glance.

## Requirements
* **Python 3.12** (older 3.x should also work)
* **Sysinternals Sysmon v15+** in your `%PATH%` (tested with Sysmon64 v15.15)

## How to Use
1. Place `katsudon.py` and `sysmon_config.xml` in the same folder.  
2. Double-click `katsudon.py` **or** launch it from *Command Prompt* / *Windows Terminal*.

## Optional Third-Party Software
* **[FLARE-FakeNet-NG](https://github.com/mandiant/flare-fakenet-ng)** ‚Äì a user-mode network simulator that simplifies traffic capture and redirection during dynamic analysis.
